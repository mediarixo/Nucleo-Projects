# Nucleo-MCP23S17
STM32NUCLEO-interfacing-with-MCP23S17-IO-CHIP-EXPANDER

Nucleo-MCP23S17 is a small C library that allows the STM32-Nucleo Cortex-M microcontroller (i.e. STM32F401RE) to drive MCP23S17 Chip as 16-Bit I/O Expander with Serial Interface. Current directory contains a README file which describes the toolchain and the pin-out used. A schematic is also included.
