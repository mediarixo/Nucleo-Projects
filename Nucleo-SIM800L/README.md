# Nucleo-SIM800L
STM32NUCLEO-interfacing-with-SIM800L-CHIP-MODULE

Nucleo-SIM800L is a small C library that allows the STM32-Nucleo Cortex-M microcontroller (i.e. STM32F401RE) to drive SIM800L Chip Module via USART Interface. Current directory contains a README file which describes the toolchain and the pin-out used.
