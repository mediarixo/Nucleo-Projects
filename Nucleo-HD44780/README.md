# Nucleo-HD44780
STM32NUCLEO-interfacing-with-HD44780-LCD

Nucleo-HD44780 is a small C library that allows the STM32-Nucleo Cortex-Microcontroller (i.e. STM32F401RE) to drive Dot-Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays, in particular Hitachi HD44780-compatible LCDs. The library provides method as accessing the LCD with 8-bits using GPIO ports. Include directory contains a README file which describes the toolchain and the pin-out used.
