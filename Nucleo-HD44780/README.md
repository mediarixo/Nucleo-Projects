# Nucleo-HD44780
STM32NUCLEO-interfacing-with-HD44780-LCD

Nucleo-HD44780 is a small C library that allows the STM32-Nucleo Cortex-Microcontroller (i.e. STM32F401RE) to drive Dot-Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays, in particular Hitachi HD44780-compatible LCDs. The library provides two methods as accessing the LCD using GPIO ports with either 8-bits or 4-bits routines. Current directory contains a README file which describes the toolchain and the pin-out used. A schematic is also included.
